    <p>
      Hi, I'm Andrew and I love Chettz. Chettz doesn't have this domain name, but I
      do. I think it's important to keep a record of anything Chettz does, because
      let's face it, he won't be around forever: but maybe this site will! Future
      generations will be able to enjoy all the things Chettz got up to while he was
      alive. Anyway, I'm going to stuff this page with all sorts of fun Chettz
      material. Love, Andrew xxx

      Here is a picture of Chettz with his friends. He must like this picture,
      because it's his Facebook profile picture. Ahhh Chettz.
